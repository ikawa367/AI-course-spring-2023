    "\n",
    "## 1. What is the mpact of the very large or very small population size?\n",
    "If the population is too large it takes long to produce each generation. But if it's too small it takes lots of iterations to find the optimal answer cause variation of chromosome combinations are so low.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is the impact of increasing the population size on the accuracy and the time complexity?\n",
    "It takes longer and longer to produce the generation in each iteration. But It is more accurate cause we can have more fit chidren from the chosen fit parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the impact of crossover and mutation? Compare. Is it possible to use only one of them?\n",
    "Crossover makes new chromosomes from a parent. Its important cause we are more likely to choose parents with the most fitness values so the combination of two fit parents might lead us to the answer. But mutation is just as important as crossover is. We need to generate some of the gens randomly cause in some cases crossover does not lead us to the answer and no one of the parents have the gen that we need to reach the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What are other techniques to reach the goal state faster in this case?\n",
    "Using elit population in the next generation can be helpful. We can also try techniques other than roulette wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Sometimes chromosomes dont change during a generation iteration. Why this issue happens? How can it be solved?\n",
    "It happens if the mutation rate value is so low and the diversity of the population is not as much as we are expecting it to be and chromosomes are so alike. In this case we get stuck suboptimal situation and it takes lots of generations to reach the goal state. By increasing mutation rate or using other techniques in crossover (such as uniform crossover) this issue can be solved.\n",
